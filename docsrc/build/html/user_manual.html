<p>MG-RAST provides Science as a Service for environmental DNA
(“metagenomic sequences”) at <a class="reference external" href="https://mg-rast.org">https://mg-rast.org</a>.</p>
<p>The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), a division of the
National Institutes of Health, publishes information (see Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#fig:cost_per_megabase">[fig:cost_per_megabase]</a>) describing the
development of computing costs and DNA sequencing costs over time
(Institute 2012). The dramatic gap between the shrinking costs of
sequencing and the more or less stable costs of computing is a major
challenge for biomedical researchers trying to use next-generation DNA
sequencing platforms to obtain information on microbial communities.
Wilkening <em>et al.</em> (Wilkening et al. 2009) provide a real currency cost
for the analysis of 100 gigabasepairs of DNA sequence data using BLASTX
on Amazon’s EC2 service: $300,000. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id1">[1]</a> A more recent study by
University of Maryland researchers (Angiuoli et al. 2011) estimates the
computation for a terabase of DNA shotgun data using their CLOVR
metagenome analysis pipeline at over $5 million per terabase.</p>

</div>
<p>Nevertheless, the growth in data enabled by next-generation sequencing
platforms also provides an exciting opportunity for studying microbial
communities: &nbsp;99% of the microbes in which have not yet been cultured
(Riesenfeld, Schloss, and Handelsman 2004). Cultivation-free methods
(often summarized as metagenomics) offer novel insights into the biology
of the vast majority of life on Earth (Thomas, Gilbert, and Meyer 2012).</p>
<p>Several types of studies use DNA for environmental analyses:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Environmental clone libraries (functional metagenomics): use of
Sanger sequencing (frequently) instead of more cost-efficient
next-generation sequencing</li>
<li>Amplicon metagenomics (single gene studies, 16s rDNA):
next-generation sequencing of PCR amplified ribosomal genes providing
a single reference gene–based view of microbial community ecology</li>
<li>Shotgun metagenomics: use of next-generation technology applied
directly to environmental samples</li>
<li>Metatranscriptomics: use of cDNA transcribed from mRNA</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these methods has strengths and weaknesses (see (Thomas,
Gilbert, and Meyer 2012)), as do the various sequencing technologies
(see (Loman et al. 2012)).</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">To support user-driven analysis of all types of metagenomic data, we
have provided MG-RAST (Meyer et al. 2008) to enable researchers to
study the function and composition of microbial communities. The
MG-RAST portal offers automated quality control, annotation,
comparative analysis, and archiving services. At the time of writing
MG-RAST has completed the analysis of over 100 terabasepairs of DNA
data in over 250,000 datasets contributed by thousands of researchers
worldwide.</div>
<div class="line">The MG-RAST system provides answers to the following scientific
questions:</div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Who is out there? Identifying the composition of a microbial
community either by using amplicon data for single genes or by
deriving community composition from shotgun metagenomic data using
sequence similarities.</li>
<li>What are they doing? Using shotgun data (or metatranscriptomic data)
to derive the functional complement of a microbial community using
similarity searches against a number of databases.</li>
<li>Who is doing what? Based on sequence similarity searches, identifying
the organisms encoding specific functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The system supports the analysis of the prokaryotic content of samples,
analysis of viruses and eukaryotic sequences is not currently supported,
due to software limitations.</p>
<p>MG-RAST users can upload raw sequence data in fastq, fasta and sff
format; the sequences will be normalized (quality controlled) and
processed and summaries automatically generated. The server provides
several methods to access the different data types, including
phylogenetic and metabolic reconstructions, and the ability to compare
the metabolism and annotations of one or more metagenomes, individually
or in groups. Access to the data is password protected unless the owner
has made it public, and all data generated by the automated pipeline is
available for download in variety of common formats.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="brief-description">
<span id="section-brief-description"></span><h2>Brief description<a class="headerlink" href="#brief-description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The MG-RAST pipeline performs quality control, protein prediction,
clustering and similarity-based annotation on nucleic acid sequence
datasets using a number of bioinformatics tools (see Section
<a class="reference external" href="#section:bioinformatics-codes">13.2.1</a>. MG-RAST was built to analyze
large shotgun metagenomic data sets ranging in size from megabases to
terabases. We also support amplicon (16S, 18S, and ITS) sequence
datasets and metatranscriptome (RNA-seq) sequence datasets. The current
MG-RAST pipeline is not capable of predicting coding regions from
eukaryotes and thus will be of limited use for eukaryotic shotgun
metagenomes and/or the eukaryotic subsets of shotgun metagenomes.</p>
<p>Data on MG-RAST is private to the submitting user unless shared with
other users or made public by the user. We strongly encourage the
eventual release of data and require metadata (“data describing data”)
for data sharing or publication. Data submitted with metadata will be
given priority for the computational queue.</p>
<p>You need to provide (raw or assembled) nucleotide sequence data and
sample descriptions (“metadata”). The system accepts sequence data in
FASTA, FASTQ and SFF format and metadata in the form or GSC (
<a class="reference external" href="http://gensc.org/">http://gensc.org/</a>
) standard compliant checklists (see Yilmaz et al, Nature Biotech,
2011). Uploads can be put in the system via either the web interface or
a command line tool. Data and metadata are validated after upload.</p>
<p>You must choose quality control filtering options at the time you submit
your job. MG-RAST provides several options for quality control (QC)
filtering for nucleotide sequence data, including removal of artificial
duplicate reads, quality-based read trimming, length-based read
trimming, and screening for DNA of model organisms (or humans). These
filters are applied before the data are submitted for annotation.</p>
<p>The MG-RAST pipeline assigns an accession number and puts the data in a
queue for computation. The similarity search step is computationally
expensive. Small jobs can complete as fast as hours, while large jobs
can spend a week waiting in line for computational resources.</p>
<p>MG-RAST performs a protein similarity search between predicted proteins
and database proteins (for shotgun) and a nucleic-acid similarity search
(for reads similar to 16S and 18S sequences).</p>
<p>MG-RAST presents the annotations via the tools on the analysis page
which prepare, compare, display, and export the results on the website.
The download page offers the input data, data at intermediate stages of
filtering, the similarity search output, and summary tables of functions
and organisms detected.</p>
<p>MG-RAST can compare thousands of data sets run through a consistent
annotation pipeline. We also provide a means to view annotations in
multiple different namespaces (e.g. SEED functions, K.O. Terms, Cog
Classes, EGGnoggs) via the M5Nr.</p>
<p>The publication “Metagenomics-a guide from sampling to data analysis”
(PMID 22587947) in Microbial Informatics and Experimentation, 2012 is a
good review of best practices for experiment design for further reading.</p>

<h2>Version history<a class="headerlink" href="#version-history" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="version-1">
<h3>Version 1<a class="headerlink" href="#version-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The original version of MG-RAST was developed in 2007 by Folker Meyer,
Andreas Wilke, Daniel Paarman, Bob Olson, and Rob Edwards. It relied
heavily on the SEED(Overbeek et al. 2005) environment and allowed upload
of preprocessed 454 and Sanger data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-2">
<h3>Version 2<a class="headerlink" href="#version-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Version 2, released in 2008, had numerous improvements. It was optimized
to handle full-sized 454 datasets and was the first version of MG-RAST
that was not fully SEED based. Version 2.0 used BLASTX analysis for both
gene prediction and functional classification(Meyer et al. 2008).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-3">
<h3>Version 3<a class="headerlink" href="#version-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While version 2 of MG-RAST was widely used, it was limited to datasets
smaller than a few hundred megabases, and comparison of samples was
limited to pairwise comparisons. Version 3 is not based on SEED
technology; instead, it uses the SEED subsystems as a preferred data
source. Starting with version 3, MG-RAST moved to github.</p>
<div class="section" id="version-3-6">
<h4>Version 3.6<a class="headerlink" href="#version-3-6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>With version 3.6 MG-RAST was containerized, moving from a bare metal
infrastructure to a set of docker containers running in a
Fleet/SystemD/etcD environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-4">
<h4>Version 4<a class="headerlink" href="#version-4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Version 4.0 brings a new web interface, fully relying on the API for
data access and moves the bulk of the data stored from Postgres to
Cassandra. The new web interface moves the data visualization burden
from the web server to the clients machine, using Javascript and HTML5
heavily.</p>
<p>In version 4.0 we have moved the changed the backend store for profiles.
While previous version stored a pre-computed mapping of observed
abundances to functional or taxonomic categories, this is now computed
on the fly. The number of profiles stored is reduced to the MD5 and LCA
profiles. The API has been augmented to allow dynamic mapping to
categories, to provide the required bandwidth we have migrated the
profile store from Postgres to Cassandra.</p>
<p>The web interface of the previous version predated the API, the user
interface for version 4.0 now uses the API. The web interface has been
re-written in JavaScript/HTML5. Unlike previous version the web
interface now is executed on the client (inside the browser) and now
soupports any recent browser.</p>
<p>With version 4.04 we are switching the main web site to be mg-rast.org
and are also turning on https by default. For a limited time, the
unencrypted access protocols will remain available. We encourage all
users to upgrade their bookmarks and also install upgraded versions of
the CRAN package and/or the python tool suite. We also switched the
similarity tool to Diamond(Buchfink, Xie, and Huson 2015).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="comparison-of-versions-2-and-3">
<h3>Comparison of versions 2 and 3<a class="headerlink" href="#comparison-of-versions-2-and-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Version 3 added the ability to analyze massive amounts of Illumina reads
by introducing a significant number of changes to the pipeline and the
underlying platform technology. In version 3 we introduced the notion of
the API as the central component of the system.</p>
<p>In the 3.0 version, datasets of tens of gigabases can be annotated, and
comparison of taxa or functions that differ between samples is now
limited only by the available screen real estate. Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#fig:mgrastv2VSv3">1.1</a> shows a comparison of the analytical and
computational approaches used in MG-RAST v2 and v3. The major changes
are the inclusion of a dedicated gene-calling stage using FragGenescan
(Rho, Tang, and Ye 2010), clustering of predicted proteins at 90%
identified by using uclust (Edgar 2010), and the use of BLAT (Kent 2002)
for the computation of similarities. Together with changes in the
underlying infrastructure, this version has allowed dramatic scaling of
the analysis with the limited hardware available.</p>
<p>Similar to version 2.0, the new version of MG-RAST does not pretend to
know the correct parameters for the transfer of annotations. Instead,
users are empowered to choose the best parameters for their datasets.</p>

<h3>Comparison of versions 3 and 4<a class="headerlink" href="#comparison-of-versions-3-and-4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The roadmap for version 4 has a number of key elements that will be
implemented step-by-step, currently the following features are
implemented:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>New JavaScript web interface using the API</li>
<li>Cassandra instead of Postgres as main data store for profiles</li>

<p>The new version of MG-RAST represents a rethinking of core processes and
data products, as well as new user interface metaphors and a redesigned
computational infrastructure. MG-RAST supports a variety of user-driven
analyses, including comparisons of many samples, previously too
computationally intensive to support for an open user community.</p>
<p>Scaling to the new workload required changes in two areas: the
underlying infrastructure needed to be rethought, and the analysis
pipeline needed to be adapted to address the properties of the newest
sequencing technologies.</p>

<h2>The supporting technologies: Skyport, AWE and SHOCK<a class="headerlink" href="#the-supporting-technologies-skyport-awe-and-shock" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One key aspect of scaling MG-RAST to large numbers of modern NGS
datasets is the use of cloud computing <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id9" id="id2">[2]</a>, which decouples MG-RAST
from its previous dedicated hardware resources.</p>
<p>We use AWE (Wilke et al. 2011) an efficient, open source resource
manager to execute the MG-RAST workflow. We expanded AWE to work with
Linux containers forming the Skyport system (Gerlach et al. 2014). AWE
and Skyport use RESTful interfaces thus allowing the addition of clients
without the need to add firewall exceptions and/or massive system
reconfiguration.</p>
<p>The main MG-RAST data store is the the SHOCK data management system
(Wilke et al. 2015) developed alongside AWE. SHOCK like AWE relies on a
RESTful interface instead of a more traditional shared file system.</p>
<p>When we introduced the technologies described above to replace a shared
file system (Sun NFS mounted on several hundred nodes), we saw a speed
up of a factor of 750x on identical hardware.</p>

<p>The MG-RAST data model (see Figure <a class="reference external" href="#fig:data-model">2.2</a>) has
changed dramatically in order to handle the size of modern
next-generation sequencing datasets. In particular, we have made a
number of choices that reduce the computational and storage burden.</p>
<p>We note that the size of the derived data products for a next-generation
dataset in MG-RAST is typically about 10x the size of the actual

<li>Abundance profiles. Using abundance profiles, where we count the
number of occurrences of function or taxon per metagenomic dataset,
is one important factor that keeps the datasets manageable. Instead
of growing the dataset sizes (often with several hundred million
individual sequences per dataset), the data products now are more or
less static in size.</li>
<li>Single similarity computing step per feature type. By running exactly
one similarity computation for proteins and another one for rRNA
features, we have limited the computational requirements.</li>
<li>Clustering of features. By clustering features at 90% identity, we
reduce the number of times we compute on similar proteins. Abundant
features will be even more efficiently clustered, leading to more
compression for abundant species.</li>

<p>The pipeline shown in Figure <a class="reference external" href="#fig:mgrast-v3-pipeline">3.1</a> contains
a significant number of improvements over previous versions and is
optimized for accuracy and computational cost.</p>
<p>Using the M5nr (Wilke et al. 2012) (an MD5 nonredundant database), the
new pipeline computes results against many reference databases instead
of only SEED. Several key algorithmic improvements were needed to
support the flood of user-generated data (see Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#fig:mgrast-job-sizes">[fig:mgrast-job-sizes]</a>). Using dedicated
software to perform gene prediction instead of using a similarity-based
approach reduces runtime requirements. The additional clustering of
proteins at 90% identity reduces data while preserving biological
signals.</p>
<p>Below we describe each step of the pipeline in some detail. All datasets
generated by the individual stages of the processing pipeline are made

an approach that is significantly more expensive computationally than de
novo gene prediction. After an in-depth investigation of tool
performance (Trimble et al. 2012), we have moved to a machine learning
approach: FragGeneScan (Rho, Tang, and Ye 2010). Using this approach, we
can now predict coding regions in DNA sequences of 75 bp and longer. Our
novel approach also enables the analysis of user-provided assembled

<p>As of version 4.04 we have migrated to DIAMOND(Buchfink, Xie, and Huson

sequenced derived identifier (an MD5 checksum). Once the computation

similarities for various purposes.</p>
<p>Once the similarities are computed, we present reconstructions of the
species content of the sample based on the similarity results. We
reconstruct the putative species composition of the sample by looking at
the phylogenetic origin of the database sequences hit by the similarity

<h2>Abundance profiles<a class="headerlink" href="#abundance-profiles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Abundance profiles are the primary data product that MG-RAST’s user

<p>Using the abundance profiles, the MG-RAST system defers making a
decision on when to transfer annotations. Since there is no well-defined
threshold that is acceptable for all use cases, the abundance profiles
contain all similarities and require their users to set cut-off values.</p>
<p>The threshold for annotation transfer can be set by using the following
parameters: e-value, percent identity, and minimal alignment length.</p>
<p>The taxonomic profiles use the NCBI taxonomy. All taxonomic information
is projected against this data. The functional profiles are available
for data sources that provide hierarchical information. These currently
comprise the following.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">SEED Subsystems</p>
<p>The SEED subsystems(Overbeek et al. 2005) represent an independent

<span id="driseedetail"></span><h2>DRISEE profile<a class="headerlink" href="#drisee-profile" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>DRISEE (Keegan et al. 2012) is a method for measuring sequencing error
in whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequence data that is independent of
sequencing technology and overcomes many of the shortcomings of Phred.
It utilizes artificial duplicate reads (ADRs) to generate internal
sequence standards from which an overall assessment of sequencing error
in a sample is derived. The current implementation of DRISEE is not
suitable for amplicon sequencing data or other samples that may contain
natural duplicated sequences (e.g., eukaryotic DNA where gene
duplication and other forms of highly repetitive sequences are common)
in high abundance. &nbsp; DRISEE results are presented on the Overview page
for each MG-RAST sample for which a DRISEE profile can be determined.
Total DRISEE error presents the overall DRISEE-based assessment of the
sample as a percent error:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Total \,\, DRISEE \,\, Error = \frac{base\_errors}{total\_bases} * 100\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({base\_errors}\)</span> refers to the sum of DRISEE-detected errors
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({total\_bases}\)</span> refers to the sum of all bases considered by
DRISEE. Beneath the Total DRISEE Error, a barchart indicates the error
for the sample (the red vertical bar) as well as the minimum (barchart
initial value), maximum (barchart final value), mean <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mu)\)</span>, mean
+/- one standard deviation (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span>), and mean +/- two standard
deviations (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\sigma\)</span>) Total DRISEE Errors observed among all
samples in MG-RAST for which a DRISEE profile has been computed.</p>
<p>The DRISEE plot presents a more detailed view of the DRISEE profile; the
DRISEE percent error is displayed per base. Individual errors (A,T,C,G,
and N substitution rates as well as the InDel rate) are presented as
well as a cumulative total.</p>
<p>Users can download DRISEE values as a tab-separated file. The first line
of the file contains headers for the values in the second line. The
second line contains DRISEE percent error values for A substitutions
(A_err), T substitutions (T_err), C substitutions (C_err), G
substitutions (G_err), N substitutions (N_err), insertions and deletions
(InDel_err), and the Total DRISEE Error. The third line indicates
headers for all remaining lines. Rows 4 and 4+ present the DRISEE counts
for the indexed position across all considered bins of ADRs. Column
values represent the number of reads that match an A,T,C,G,N, or InDel
at the indicated position relative to the appropriate consensus sequence
followed by the number of reads that do not match an A,T,C,G,N, or
InDel.</p>

database sources, and the individual sequences may occur multiple times
in different strains and species (and sometimes genera) with 100%
identity. In these circumstances, choosing the “right” taxonomic
information is not a straightforward process.</p>
<p>To optimally serve a number of different use cases, we have implemented
three methods–best hit, representative hit, and lowest common
ancestor—for end users to determine the number of hits (occurrences of
the input sequence in the database) reported for a given sequence in
their dataset.</p>
<div class="section" id="best-hit">
<h3>Best hit<a class="headerlink" href="#best-hit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The best hit classification reports the functional and taxonomic
annotation of the best hit in the M5nr for each feature. In those cases
where the similarity search yields multiple same-scoring hits for a
feature, we do not choose any single “correct” label. For this reason we
have decided to double count all annotations with identical match
properties and leave determination of truth to our users. While this
approach aims to inform about the functional and taxonomic potential of
a microbial community by preserving all information, subsequent analysis
can be biased because of a single feature having multiple annotations,
leading to inflated hit counts. For users looking for a specific species
or function in their results, the best hit classification is likely what
is wanted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="representative-hit">
<h3>Representative hit<a class="headerlink" href="#representative-hit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The representative hit classification selects a single, unambiguous
annotation for each feature. The annotation is based on the first hit in
the homology search and the first annotation for that hit in our
database. This approach makes counts additive across functional and
taxonomic levels and thus allows, for example, the comparison of
functional and taxonomic profiles of different metagenomes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lowest-common-ancestor-lca">
<span id="section-lca"></span><h3>Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)<a class="headerlink" href="#lowest-common-ancestor-lca" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To avoid the problem of multiple taxonomic annotations for a single
feature, we provide taxonomic annotations based on the widely used LCA
method introduced by MEGAN (Huson et al. 2007). In this method all hits
are collected that have a bit score close to the bit score of the best
hit. The taxonomic annotation of the feature is then determined by
computing the LCA of all species in this set. This replaces all
taxonomic annotations from ambiguous hits with a single higher-level
annotation in the NCBI taxonomy tree.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="comparison-of-methods">
<h3>Comparison of methods<a class="headerlink" href="#comparison-of-methods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Users should be aware that the number of hits might be inflated if the
best hit filter is used or that a favorite species might be missing
despite a similar sequence similarity result if the representative hit
filter is used (in fact, even if a 100% identical match to a favorite
species exists).</p>
<p>One way to consider both the best hit and representative hit is that
they overinterpret the available evidence. With the LCA classifier
function, on the other hand, any input sequence is classified only down
to a trustworthy taxonomic level. While naively this seems to be the
best function to choose in all cases because it classifies sequences to
varying depths, the approach causes problems for downstream analysis
tools that might rely on everything being classified to the same level.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="numbers-of-annotations-vs-number-of-reads">
<span id="section-annotation-numbers"></span><h2>Numbers of annotations vs. number of reads<a class="headerlink" href="#numbers-of-annotations-vs-number-of-reads" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The MG-RAST v3 annotation pipeline does not usually provide a single
annotation for each submitted fragment of DNA. Steps in the pipeline map
one read to multiple annotations and one annotation to multiple reads.
These steps are a consequence of genome structure, pipeline engineering,
and the character of the sequence databases that MG-RAST uses for
annotation.</p>
<p>The first step that is not one-to-one is gene prediction. Long reads
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(&gt;\)</span> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(400\)</span>bp) and contigs can contain pieces of two or
more microbial genes; when the gene caller makes this prediction, the
multiple predicted protein sequences (called fragments) are annotated
separately.</p>
<p>An intermediate clustering step identifies sequences at 90% amino acid
identity and performs one search for each cluster. Sequences that do not
fall into clusters are searched separately. The “abundance” column in
the MG-RAST tables presents the estimate of the number of sequences that
contain a given annotation, found by multiplying each selected database
match (hit) by the number of representatives in each cluster. The final
step that is not one-to-one is the annotation process itself. Sequences
can exist in the underlying data sources many times with different
labels. When those sequence are the best hit similarity, we do not have
a principled way to choosing the “correct” label. For this reason we
have decided to double count these annotations and leave determination
of truth to our users. Note: Even when considering a single data source,
double-counting can occur depending on the consistency of annotations.
Also note: Hits refer to the number of unique database sequences that
were found in the similarity search, not the number of reads. The hit
count can be smaller than the number of reads because of clustering or
larger due to double counting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="metadata">
<span id="section-metadata"></span><h2>Metadata<a class="headerlink" href="#metadata" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>MG-RAST is both an analytical platform and a data integration system. To
enable data reuse, for example for meta-analyses, we require that all
data being made publicly available to third parties contain at least
minimal metadata. The MG-RAST team has decided to follow the minimal
checklist approach used by the Genomics Standards Consortium (GSC)(Field
et al. 2011).</p>
<p>While the GSC provides a GCDML (R. et al. 2008) encoding, this XML-based
format is more useful to programmers than to end users submitting data.
We have therefore elected to use spreadsheets to transport metadata.
Specifically we use MIxS (Minimum information about any (x) sequence
(MIxS) and MIMARKS (Minimum Information about a MARKer gene Survey) to
encode minimal metadata (Yilmaz et al. 2010).</p>
<p>The metadata describe the origins of samples and provide details on the
generation of the sequence data. While the GSC checklist aims at
capturing a minimum of information, MG-RAST can handle additional
metadata if supplied by the user. The metadata is stored in a simple key
value format and is displayed on the Metagenome Overview page.</p>
<p>Once uploaded, the metadata spreadsheets are validated automatically,
and users are informed of any problems.</p>
<p>The presence of metadata enables discovery by end users using contextual
metadata. Users can perform searches such as “retrieve soil samples from
the continental U.S.A.” If the users have added additional metadata
(domain specific extension), additional queries are enabled: for
example, “restrict the results to soils with a specific pH”.</p>

<h2>Information about specific data sets (Overview page)<a class="headerlink" href="#information-about-specific-data-sets-overview-page" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>MG-RAST automatically creates an individual summary page for each
dataset. This metagenome overview page provides a summary of the
annotations for a single dataset. The page is made available by the
automated pipeline once the computation is finished. The page is
generated using default values for annotation transfer parameters (e.g.
e-values) and thus likely does not represent good biological
information, for that please use the Analysis page (see below).</p>
<p>However the Overview page is a good starting point for looking at a
particular dataset. It provides a significant amount of information on
technical details and biological content.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The page is intended as a single point of reference for metadata,
quality, and data. It also provides an initial overview of the
analysis results for individual datasets with default parameters.
Further analyses are available on the Analysis page.</div>
<div class="line">There are four different types of Overview pages that are displayed as
required by the data:</div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Amplicon metagenome overview page</li>
<li>Shotgun metagenome overview page</li>
<li>Assembled shotgun metagenome overview page</li>
<li>Metatranscriptome overview page</li>
</ul>
<p>While the different types of overview pages are mostly identical, some
visualizations are not relevant or even possible for certain data types.
The decision which type of page to display is made based on the data,
not the metadata provided by the user.</p>
<p>Previous version of MG-RAST provided almost complete <strong>download</strong> access
to the underlying data, with version 4.0 we have expanded that to all
tables and figures. The symbol shown in Figure

</div>
<p>The Overview page provides the MG-RAST ID for a data set, a unique
identifier that is usable as accession number for publications.
Additional information such as the name of the submitting PI and
organization and a user-provided metagenome name are displayed at the
top of the page as well. A static URL for linking to the system that
will be stable across changes to the MG-RAST web interface is provided
as additional information (Figure <a class="reference external" href="#fig:metagenome-overview">5.7</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Until the data is released to the public, temporary
identifiers are made available that will be replaced by permanent valid
IDs at the time of data release. The temporary identifiers are long
numbers used to represent the data sets until they are public. Do not
use temporary identifiers in publications as they are designed to change
over time. An example for a temporary ID is
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">4fbfe5d4216d676d343733343339372e33</span></code>. A valid MG-RAST identifier is
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mgm4447101.3</span></code>. Both the API and the web site work with temporary IDs
and MG-RAST IDs.</p>
<p>The results on the Overview page (e.g. link) represent a quick summary
of the biological and technical content of each data set. In the past we
use a relatively simple approach (best-hit) to compute the biological
information. Our reasoning was based on the fact that the “real”
meaningful data was presented via the Analysis Page.</p>
<p>With version 4.04 we are now presenting an updated Overview page,
results on this page are based on the lowest common ancestor (LCA)
algorithm (see Figure <a class="reference external" href="#fig:lca">5.6</a>). The LCA (or most recent
common ancestor) for a given DNA sequence is computed by evaluating the
set of similarities observed when matching the sequence against a number
of databases.</p>
<p>To put this in very simple language, when faced with uncertainty about
which species to choose (e.g. when faced with a protein shared by many
E. coli species), the MG-RAST Overview page will display a genus level
result Escherichia (one level up from species). Likewise if no decision
can be made between Escherichia and Shigella (both genera), the LCA will
be set to Enterobacteriaceae.</p>

</div>
<p>Faced with a decision between multiple strain level hits (purple and
orange) for different species, the LCA algorithm will pick higher
(genus) level entity.</p>
<p>We note that this will change results for some data sets and cause the
analysis pages to look differently, the underlying sequence analysis
however is not affected, we merely set a new default value for the
generation of overview graphs on this page.</p>

annotated by the default pipeline. Other feature types such as small
RNAs or regulatory motifs (e.g., CRISPRs (Bolotin et al. 2005)) not only
will require significantly higher computational resources but also are
frequently not supported by the unassembled short reads that constitute
the vast majority of todays metagenomic data in MG-RAST. The quality of
the sequence data coming from next-generation instruments requires
careful design of experiments, lest the sensitivity of the methods is

<p>The alpha diversity estimate is a single number that summarizes the
distribution of species-level annotations in a dataset. The Shannon
diversity index is an abundance-weighted average of the logarithm of the
relative abundances of annotated species.</p>
<p>We compute the species richness as the antilog of the Shannon diversity:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\textrm{Richness} = 10^{-\sum_i  p_i \log(p_i) }\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_i\)</span> are the proportions of annotations in each of the
species categories. Shannon species richness has units of the “effective
number of species”. Each <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> is a ratio of the number of
annotations for each species to the total number of annotations. The
species-level annotations are from all the annotation source databases
used by MG-RAST. The table of species and number of observations used to
calculate this diversity estimate can be downloaded under “download

</div>
<div class="section" id="normalization">
<h3>Normalization<a class="headerlink" href="#normalization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Normalization refers to a transformation that attempts to reshape an
underlying distribution. MG-RAST now uses DEseq, which is an R package
to analyse count data from high-throughput sequencing assays. DESeq, as
it has been shown to outperform other methods of normalization - in
particular, those that use any sort of linear scaling.</p>
<p>Standardization is a transformation applied to each distribution in a
group of distributions so that all distributions exhibit the same mean
and the same standard deviation. This removes some aspects of
intersample variability and can make data more comparable. This sort of
procedure is analogous to commonly practiced scaling procedures but is
more robust in that it controls for both scale and location.</p>
<p>The Analysis page calculates the ordination visualizations with either
raw or normalized counts, at the user’s option. The normalization
procedure is as follows.</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(normalized\_value\_i = log2(raw\_counts\_i + 1)\)</span></p>
<p>The standardized values then are calculated from the normalized values
by subtracting the mean of each sample’s normalized values and dividing
by the standard deviation of each sample’s normalized values.</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(standardized\_i = (normalized\_i - mean(normalized\_i)) / stddev(normalized\_i)\)</span></p>
<p>More about these procedures is available in a number of texts. We
recommend Terry Speed’s “Statistical Analysis of Gene Expression in
Microarray Data” (Speed 2003).</p>
<p>When data exhibit a nonnormal, normal, or unknown distribution,
nonparametric tests (e.g., Man-Whitney or Kurskal-Wallis) should be
used. Boxplots are easy to use, and the MG-RAST analysis page provides
boxplots of the standardized abundance values for checking the
comparability of samples (Figure <a class="reference external" href="#fig:boxplots">5.17</a>).</p>

<span id="id5"></span><h3>Rarefaction<a class="headerlink" href="#section-analysis-page-rarefaction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The rarefaction view is available only for taxonomic data. The
rarefaction curve of annotated species richness is a plot (see Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#fig:analysis-page-rarefaction-example">5.18</a>) of the total number
of distinct species annotations as a function of the number of sequences
sampled. As shown in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#fig:analysis-page-rarefaction-example">5.18</a>, multiple data sets
can be included.</p>
<p>The slope of the right-hand part of the curve is related to the fraction
of sampled species that are rare. When the rarefaction curve is flat,
more intensive sampling is likely to yield only a few additional
species. The rarefaction curve is derived from the protein taxonomic
annotations and is subject to problems stemming from technical
artifacts. These artifacts can be similar to the ones affecting amplicon
sequencing (Reeder and Knight 2009), but the process of inferring
species from protein similarities may introduce additional uncertainty.</p>
<p>On the Analysis page the rarefaction plot serves as a means of comparing
species richness between samples in a way independent of the sampling
depth.</p>

<p>On the left, a steep slope indicates that a large fraction of the
species diversity remains to be discovered. If the curve becomes flatter
to the right, a reasonable number of individuals is sampled: more
intensive sampling is likely to yield only a few additional species.</p>
<p>Sampling curves generally rise very quickly at first and then level off
toward an asymptote as fewer new species are found per unit of
individuals collected. These rarefaction curves are calculated from the
table of species abundance. The curves represent the average number of
different species annotations for subsamples of the the complete
dataset.</p>

<div class="section" id="kegg-mapper">
<span id="section-kegg-mapper"></span><h3>KEGG mapper<a class="headerlink" href="#kegg-mapper" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The KEGG map tool allows the visual comparison of predicted metabolic
pathways in metagenomic samples. It maps the abundance of identified
enzymes onto a KEGG (Kanehisa 2002) map of functional pathways; note
that the mapper is available only for functional data). Users can select
from any available KEGG pathway map. Different colors indicate different
metagenomic datasets.</p>
<p>The KEGG mapper works by providing two buffers that users can assign
datasets to. After loading the buffers with the intended datasets, the
KEGG mapper can highlight parts of the KEGG map that are present in the
dataset. Several combinations of the two datasets can be displayed, as
shown in Figure <a class="reference external" href="#fig:analysis-page-kegg-mapper-options">5.19</a>.
Metagenomes can be assigned into one of two groups, and those groups can

<p>The heatmap/dendrogram (Figure <a class="reference external" href="#fig:heatmap">5.22</a>) allows an

has two dendrograms, one indicating the similarity/dissimilarity among
metagenomic samples (x-axis dendrogram) and another indicating the
similarity/dissimilarity among annotation categories (e.g., functional
roles; the y-axis dendrogram). A distance metric is evaluated between
every possible pair of sample abundance profiles. A clustering algorithm
(e.g., ward-based clustering) then produces the dendrogram trees. Each
square in the heatmap dendrogram represents the abundance level of a
single category in a single sample. The values used to generate the
heatmap/dendrogram figure can be downloaded as a table by clicking on

</div>
<div class="section" id="ordination">
<h3>Ordination<a class="headerlink" href="#ordination" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>MG-RAST uses Principle Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) to reduce the
dimensionality of comparisons of multiple samples that consider
functional or taxonomic annotations. Dimensionality reduction is a
process that allows the complex variation found in a large datasets
(e.g., the abundance values of thousands of functional roles or
annotated species across dozens of metagenomic samples) to be reduced to
a much smaller number of variables that can be visualized as simple two-
or three-dimensional scatter plots. The plots enable interpretation of
the multidimensional data in a human-friendly presentation. Samples that
exhibit similar abundance profiles (taxonomic or functional) group
together, whereas those that differ are found farther apart.</p>
<p>A key feature of PCoA-based analyses is that users can compare
components not just to each other but to metadata recorded variables
(e.g., sample pH, biome, DNA extraction protocol) to reveal correlations
between extracted variation and metadata-defined characteristics of the
samples. It is also possible to couple PCoA with higher-resolution
statistical methods in order to identify individual sample features
(taxa or functions) that drive correlations observed in PCoA
visualizations. This coupling can be accomplished with permutation-based
statistics applied directly to the data before calculation of distance
measures used to produce PCoAs; alternatively, one can apply
conventional statistical approaches (e.g., ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test)
to groups observed in PCoA-based visualizations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="table">
<h3>Table<a class="headerlink" href="#table" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The table tool creates a spreadsheet-based abundance table that can be
searched and restricted by the user. Tables can be generated at
user-selected levels of phylogenetic or functional resolution. Table
data can be visualized by using Krona (Ondov, Bergman, and Phillippy
2011) or can be exported in BIOM(McDonald et al. 2012) format to be used
in other tools (e.g., QIIME (Caporaso et al. 2010)). The tables also can
be exported as tab-separated text.</p>
<p>Abundance tables serve as the basis for all comparative analysis tools
in MG-RAST, from PCoA to heatmap/dendrograms.</p>
<p>Consider the following example showing how to use the taxonomic
information derived from an analysis of protein similarities found for
the data set 4447970.3. We use the best hit classification, SEED
database, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{-5}\)</span> evalue, 60% identity, and a minimal alignment
length of 15 amino acids. We select table output. The results are shown

<h2>SOP - Metagenome submission, publication and submission to INSDC via MG-RAST<a class="headerlink" href="#sop-metagenome-submission-publication-and-submission-to-insdc-via-mg-rast" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>MG-RAST can be used to host data for public access. There are three
interfaces for uploading and publishing data, the Web interface,
intended for most users, command line scripts, intended for programmers,
and the native RESTful API, recommended for experienced programmers.</p>
<p>When data is published in MG-RAST, it can also be released to the INSDC
databases. This tutorial covers both use cases.</p>
<p>We note that MG-RAST provides temporary IDs and permanent public
identifiers. The permanent identifiers are assigned at the time data is
made public. Permanent MG-RAST identifiers begin with “mgm” (e.g.
“mgm4449249.3”) for data sets and mgp (e.g.”mgp128”) for
projects/studies.</p>
<p>The following data types are supported:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Shotgun metagenomes (“raw” and assembled)</li>
<li>Metatranscriptome data (“raw” and assembled)</li>
<li>Ribosomal amplicon data (16s, 18s, ITS amplicons)</li>
<li>Metabarcoding data (e.g. cytochrome C amplicons; basically all non
ribosomal amplicons)</li>
</ul>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: We strongly prefer raw data over assembled data, if you
submit assembled data, please submit the raw reads in parallel. If you
perform local optimization e.g. adapter removal or quality clipping,
please submit the raw data as well.</p>
<p>This document is intended for experienced to very experienced users and
programmers. We recommend that most users not use the RESTful API. There
is also a document describing data publication and INSDC submission via
the web UI.</p>
<p>An access token for the MG-RAST API, this can be obtained from the
MG-RAST web page (<a class="reference external" href="http://mg-rast.org">http://mg-rast.org</a>) in the user section.</p>
<p>You will need a working python interpreter and the command line scripts
and example data can be found in

<h3>SOP:<a class="headerlink" href="#sop" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Upload and submit sequence data and metadata to MG-RAST using the
command mg-submit.py Note: This is an asynchronous process that may take
some time depending on the size and number of datasets. (Note: We
recommend that novice users try the web frontend; the cmd-line is
primarily intended for programmers) The metadata in this example is in
Microsoft Excel format, there is also an option of using JSON formatted
data. Please note: We have observed multiple problems with spreadsheets
that were converted from older version of Excel or “compatible” tools
e.g. OpenOffice.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">mg</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">submit</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">py</span> <span class="n">submit</span> <span class="n">simple</span>  <span class="o">....</span>  <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">metadata</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Verify the results and obtain a temporary identifier E.g. by using the
WebUI at <a class="reference external" href="http://mg-rast.org">http://mg-rast.org</a> – you can also use that to publish the data
and trigger submission to INSDC.</p>
<p>Publish your project in MG-RAST and obtain a stable and public MG-RAST
project identifier</p>
<p>Note: once the data is made public the data is read only, but metadata
can be improved</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mg-project make-public $temporary_ID
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Trigger release to INSDC/ submit to EBI</p>
<p>Note: Metadata updates are automatically synced with INSDC databases
within 48 hours.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mg-project submit-ebi $PROJECT_ID
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Check status of release to INSDC/ submission to EBI</p>

<span id="section-generating-metadata"></span><h3>Generating metadata for the submission<a class="headerlink" href="#generating-metadata-for-the-submission" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>MG-RAST uses questionnaires to capture metadata for each project with
one or more samples. Users have two options, they can download and fill
out the questionnaire and then submit it or use our online editor,
MetaZen. Questionnaires are validated automatically by MG-RAST for
completeness and compliance with the controlled vocabularies for certain
fields.</p>
<p>MG-RAST has implemented the use of Minimum Information about any (X)
Sequence (MIxS)(Yilmaz et al. 2010) developed by the Genomic Standards
Consortium. In addition to the minimal checklists, more detailed data
can be captured in optional environmental packages.</p>
<p>We use simple spreadsheets to capture metadata, with a minimal number of
required fields (in red in the spreadsheets) and a number of optional
fields. The spreadsheet is separated into multiple tabs representing the
different metadata categories. The MG-RAST metadata spreadsheet template
is available on the MG-RAST upload page or at
<a class="reference external" href="ftp://ftp.mg-rast.org/data/misc/metadata/MGRAST_MetaData_template_1.3.xlsx">ftp://ftp.mg-rast.org/data/misc/metadata/MGRAST_MetaData_template_1.3.xlsx</a>.</p>
<p>A filled-out version of the spreadsheet is available at

<p>In Figure <a class="reference external" href="#fig:project-spreadsheet">9.4</a> we show the template tab

</div>
<p>Required sheets</p>
<p>You need to fill out four sheets to describe your metadata:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Project – This sheet has only one row, and describes a set of samples
uploaded together; the other sheets have one row per sample.</li>
<li>Sample – This sheet includes either the filename or metagenome name
used for matching.</li>
<li>Library – This sheet includes either the metagenome (for WGS and
WXS), mimarks-survey (for 16s and amplicon) or metatranscriptome.</li>
<li>Environmental package (ep) – Several packages of suggested standard
metadata are available. Choose the package that best describes your
dataset (e.g., water, human-skin, soil).</li>
</ol>
<p>Sample sheet</p>
<p>The sample sheet requires minimal information (including the sample
name) about where and when the sample was taken. Note that some fields
in the spreadsheet must be filled out with terms from a controlled
vocabulary or in a certain way. Country and environment (biome, feature,
material) fields require entries from curated ontologies, gazetteer and
environmental ontology, respectively.</p>
<p>Figure <a class="reference external" href="#fig:project-spreadsheet-with-3-samples">9.6</a> shows the
sample tab with three new samples (sample1, sample2, and sample3) added.
Again red text in the first row indicates required fields.</p>
<p>Mandatory fields</p>
<p>Five fields must be completed.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Country – e.g. United States of America, Netherlands, Australia,
Uruguay</li>
<li>Latitude and longitude – e.g. [106.84517, -104.60667],
[2842.306:math:<cite>’</cite>N, 8824.099<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\('\)</span>W], [45.30 N, 73.35 W]</li>
<li>Biome – e.g. small lake biome, urban biome, mangrove biome. This term
must be one of the terms from the bioportal ontology
(<a class="reference external" href="http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1069?p=terms&amp;conceptid=ENVO%3A00000428">http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1069?p=terms&amp;conceptid=ENVO%3A00000428</a>).
Terms that are not listed on this site are not valid.</li>
<li>Feature – e.g. city, fish farm, livestock-associated habitat, marine
habitat, ocean basin, microbial mat. This term must be one of the
terms from the bioportal ontology. Terms that are not listed on this
site are not valid.</li>
<li>Material – e.g. air, dust, volcanic soil, saliva, blood, dairy
product, surface water, piece of gravel. This term must be one of the
terms from the bioportal ontology. Terms that are not listed on this
site are not valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Library section</p>
<p>The library section captures technical data on the preparation and
sequencing done. You should choose the library tab to fill out
(“metagenome” for shotgun sequencing, “mimarks-survey” for amplicon or
“metatranscriptome”) based on the type of sequencing done. These are
separated as different sequencing techniques involving different
metadata fields. Each row describes one library for one sample. The
required fields are colored red.</p>
<p>The <strong>sample_name</strong> value in the library sheet must exactly match one of
the values used in the sample sheet.</p>
<p>The <strong>file_name</strong> field holds the filename of the sequence file
uploaded, or the filename to use for creating the demultiplexed file if
you uploaded a multiplexed sequence file and have barcode sequences in
the spreadsheet. This is used for mapping sequence files to metadata.</p>
<p>The <strong>metagenome_name</strong> field holds the name of the metagenome you are
submitting. If the file_name field is empty, the metagenome_name will be
used to map metadata to sequence files, in this case it would need to
match the uploaded sequence filename without the file extension, e.g. a
sequence file “test-sequence.fasta” would be mapped to the metadata in
the row which has the metagenome_name value “test-sequence”.</p>
<p>The <strong>investigation_type</strong> field is required to be “metagenome” for
shotgun metagenome samples, “mimarks-survey” for amplicon studies or
“metatrascriptome”, reflecting which tab was filled out.</p>
<p>The type of sequencing instrument used is another required field. Values
are, for example, Sanger, pyrosequencing, ABI-solid, 454, Illumina,
assembled, other.</p>
<p>Again, only a limited number of fields are required. However, the more
information you provide, the easier it is for you and others to
understand any potential uses of your data and to understand why results
appear in a particular way. It might, for example, allow understanding
of specific biases caused by technology choices or sampled environments.</p>
<p>Environmental Package (ep) sheet</p>
<p>You can fill out one or more environmental metadata packages. Currently
we provide support for the following GSC environmental packages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Air</li>
<li>Built Environment</li>
<li>Host-associated</li>
<li>Human-associated</li>
<li>Human-oral</li>
<li>Human-skin</li>
<li>Human-gut</li>
<li>Human-vaginal</li>
<li>Microbial mat/biofilm</li>
<li>Miscellaneous natural or artificial environment</li>
<li>Plant-associated</li>
<li>Sediment</li>
<li>Soil</li>
<li>Wastewater sludge</li>
<li>Water</li>
</ul>
<p>We strongly encourage users to submit rich metadata, but we understand
the effort required in providing it. Using the environmental packages
(which were designed and are used by practitioners in the respective
field) should make it reasonably simple to report the essential metadata
required to analyze the data. If there is no environmental package to
report metadata for your specific sample, please contact MG-RAST staff:
we will work with the GSC(Field et al. 2011) to create the required
questionnaire.</p>
<div class="section" id="using-metazen">
<span id="section-using-metazen"></span><h4>Using MetaZen<a class="headerlink" href="#using-metazen" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>MG-RAST uses a simple spreadsheet with 12 mandatory terms. MetaZen
designed to help you fill out your metadata spreadsheet. The metadata
you provide, helps us to analyze your data more accurately and helps
make MG-RAST a more useful analysis resource for everyone.</p>
<p>This tool will help you get started on completing your metadata
spreadsheet by filling in any information that is common across all of
your samples and/or libraries. This tool currently only allows users to
enter one environmental package for your samples and all samples must
have been sequenced by the same number of sequencing technologies with
the same number of replicates. This information is entered in tab 2.</p>
<p>Note: If your project deviates from this convention, you must either
produce multiple separate metadata spreadsheets or generate your
spreadsheet and then edit the appropriate fields manually.</p>
<p>Metazen’s online form allows users to either use an existing project, or
add in new information to start a new project (Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#fig:metazen_form">[fig:metazen_form]</a>). Users will expand each tab
and fill in their metadata information. One of the benefits to using
this form is that it provides compliant ENVO terms to select from to
describe your sample, without the cumbersome task of looking them up
outside of MG-RAST. Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#fig:metazen_expanded">[fig:metazen_expanded]</a> shows an example of
this for entering in environmental information.</p>
<p>The first tab is for project information where you enter the project
name and description as well as PI information, information for the
technical contact and cross-references to different analysis tools so
that your dataset can be linked across these resources.</p>
<p>What you enter in the second tab (sample set information) will dictate
what the next tabs will be. Note: You must submit the information here
before proceeding with the rest of the form. Enter the information about
your set of samples. First, indicate the total number of samples in your
set. Second, tell us which environmental package your samples belong to.
Then, indicate how many times each of your samples was sequenced by each
sequencing method. Each entry of more than zero for number of shotgun,
metatranscriptome or amplicon libraries will produce an additional tab
to fill out about your sample (Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#fig:metazen_step2">[fig:metazen_step2]</a>. Once you add or change
information into this form you will need to press the button “show
library input forms” to update subsequent tabs.</p>
<p>Note: It is allowable to indicate here if your samples were sequenced
using more than one sequencing method.</p>
<p>Once the data has been entered, click on “download excel spreadsheet” to
download your filled sheet. You can now use this for upload and
submission to MG-RAST.</p>

The metadata is hierarchical with three levels, project, sample and
library. There has to be a sequence file corresponding to each library
entry and the sequence filename must match the library file_name fields
or match the library metagenome_name fields minus extension. Once you
have filled out the spreadsheet with metadata you can upload it along

<h3>Do I need to compress my files before uploading to MG-RAST?<a class="headerlink" href="#do-i-need-to-compress-my-files-before-uploading-to-mg-rast" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is not required that you compress your files before uploading to
MG-RAST, but it is highly recommended.</p>
<p>Compressing your sequence data using Zip or gzip before it is uploaded
will reduce the time required for the upload. The compression rate
depends on the nature of the sequences, typical compression rates for
uploaded sequence data that we have observed is between 30-35%. This
means the time taken for the upload may be reduced by a third or even
more. On a slow connection where uploading 1GB takes over an hour this
could be a considerable reduction in time. In addition, the shortened
time will also reduce the chance of a failed upload if something goes
wrong.</p>

<p>The ‘Join paired-ends’ function on the Upload page allows users to merge
two fastq files which represent paired end reads from the same
sequencing run. The fastq-join utility
(<a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/ea-utils/wiki/FastqJoin">http://code.google.com/p/ea-utils/wiki/FastqJoin</a>) is used to merge
mate-pairs with a minimum overlap setting of 8bp and a maximum
difference of 10% (parameters: -m 8 -p 10). There is an option to retain
or remove the pairs which do not overlap—the ‘remove’ option drops
paired reads for which no overlap is found and the ‘retain’ option will
keep non-overlapping paired reads in your output file as separate
individual (non-joined) sequences. There is also an option to include an
index file (if you have one) that contains the barcode for each
mate-pair. If this file is included, the barcodes will be
reverse-complemented and then prepended to the output sequences.</p>

<h1>Putting It All in Perspective<a class="headerlink" href="#putting-it-all-in-perspective" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>We have described MG-RAST, a community resource for the analysis of
metagenomic sequence data. We have developed a new pipeline and
environment for automated analysis of shotgun metagenomic data, as well
as a series of interactive tools for comparative analysis. The pipeline
is also being used for analyzing metatranscriptome data as well as
amplicon data of various kinds. This service is being used by thousands
of users worldwide, many contributing their data and analysis results to
the community. We believe that community resources such as MG-RAST will
fill a vital role in the bioinformatics ecosystem in the years to come.</p>
<div class="section" id="mg-rast-a-community-resource">
<h2>MG-RAST, a community resource<a class="headerlink" href="#mg-rast-a-community-resource" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>MG-RAST has become a community clearinghouse for metagenomic data and
analysis, with over 12,000 public datasets that can be freely used.
Because analysis was performed in a uniform way, these datasets can
serve as building blocks for new comparative analysis; so long as new
datasets are analyzed similarly, results are robustly comparable between
new and old dataset analysis. These datasets (and the resulting analysis
data products) are made available for download and reuse as well.</p>
<p>Community resources like MG-RAST provide a clear value proposition to
the metagenomics community. First, it enables low-cost meta-analysis.
Users utilize the data products in MG-RAST as a basis for comparison
without the need to reanalyze every dataset used in their studies. The
high computational cost of analysis (Wilkening et al. 2009) makes
precomputation a prerequisite for large-scale meta-analyses. In 2001,
Angiuli et al.&nbsp;(Angiuoli et al. 2011) determined the real currency cost
of reanalysis for the over 12,000 datasets openly available on MG-RAST
to be in excess of $30 million if Amazon’s EC2 platform is used. This
figure does not consider the 66,000 private datasets that have been
analyzed with MG-RAST.</p>
<p>Second, it provides incentives to the community to adopt standards, in
terms of both metadata and analysis approaches. Without this
standardization, data products are not readily reusable, and
computational costs quickly become unsustainable. We are not arguing
that a single analysis is necessarily suitable for all users; rather, we
are pointing out that if one particular type of analysis is run for all
datasets, the results can be efficiently reused, amortizing costs. Open
access to data and analyses foster community interactions that make it
easier for researchers’ efforts to achieve consensus with respect to
establishing best practices as well as identifying methods and analyses
that could provide misleading results.</p>
<p>Third, community resources drive increased efficiency and computational
performance. Community resources consolidate the demand for analysis
resources sufficiently to drive innovation in algorithms and approaches.
Because of this demand, the MG-RAST team has needed to scale the
efficiency of their pipeline by a factor of nearly 1,000 over the past
four years. This drive has caused improvements in gene calling,
clustering, and sequence quality analysis, as well as many other areas.
In less specialized groups with less extreme computational needs, this
sort of efficiency gain would be difficult to achieve. Moreover, the
large quantities of datasets that flow through the system have forced
the hardening of the pipeline against a large variety of sequence
pathology types that would not be readily observed in smaller systems.</p>
<p>We believe that our experiences in the design and operation of MG-RAST
are representative of bioinformatics as a whole. The community resource
model is critical if we are to benefit from the exponential growth in
sequence data. This data has the potential to enable new insights into
the world around us, but only if we can analyze it effectively. Only
because of this approach have we been able to scale to the demands of
our users effectively, analyzing over 200 billion sequences thus far.</p>
<p>We note that scaling to the required throughput by adding hardware to
the system or simply renting time using an unoptimized pipeline on. For
example, Amazon’s EC2 machine would not be economically feasible. The
real currency cost on EC2 for the data currently analyzed in MG-RAST (26
terabasepairs) would be in excess of $100 million using an unoptimized
workflow such as CLOVR (Angiuoli et al. 2011).</p>
<p>All of MG-RAST is open source and available on

<h2>Future Work<a class="headerlink" href="#future-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While MG-RAST v3 is a substantial improvement over prior systems, much
work remains to be done. Dataset sizes continue to increase at an
exponential pace. Keeping up with this change remains a top priority, as
metagenomics users continue to benefit from increased resolution of
microbial communities. Upcoming versions of MG-RAST will include (1)
mechanisms for speeding pipeline up using data reduction strategies that
are biologically motivated; (2) opening up the data ecosystem via an API
that will enable third-party development and enhancements; (3) providing
distributed compute capabilities using user-provided resources; and (4)
providing virtual integration of local datasets to allow comparison
between local data and shared data without requiring full integration.</p>

<p><strong>Uploaded File(s) DNA</strong> (4465825.3.25422.fna)</p>
<p>Uploaded nucleotide sequence data in FASTA format. Preprocessing</p>
<p>Depending on the options chosen, the preprocessing step filters
sequences based on length, number of ambiguous bases and quality values
if available.</p>
<p><strong>passed, DNA</strong> (4465825.3.100.preprocess.passed.fna)</p>
<p>A FASTA formatted file containing the sequences which were accepted and
will be passed on to the next stage of the analysis pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>removed, DNA</strong> (4465825.3.100.preprocess.removed.fna)</p>
<p>A FASTA formatted file containing the sequences which were rejected and
will not be passed on to the next stage of the analysis pipeline.
Dereplication</p>
<p>The optional dereplication step removes redundant “technical replicate”
sequences from the metagenomic sample. Technical replicates are
identified by binning reads with identical first 50 base-pairs. One copy
of each 50-base-pair identical bin is retained.</p>
<p><strong>passed, DNA</strong> (4465825.3.150.dereplication.passed.fna)</p>
<p>A FASTA formatted file containing one sequence from each bin which will
be passed on to the next stage of the analysis pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>removed, DNA</strong> (4465825.3.150.dereplication.removed.fna)</p>
<p>A FASTA formatted file containing the sequences which were identified as
technical replicates and will not be passed on to the next stage of the
analysis pipeline. Screening</p>
<p>The optional screening step screens reads against model organisms using
bowtie to remove reads which are similar to the genome of the selected
species.</p>
<p><strong>passed, DNA</strong> (4465825.3.299.screen.passed.fna)</p>
<p>A FASTA formatted file containing the reads which which had no
similarity to the selected genome and will be passed on to the next
stage of the analysis pipeline. Prediction of protein coding sequences</p>
<p>Coding regions within the sequences are predicted using FragGeneScan, an
ab-initio prokaryotic gene calling algorithm. Using a hidden Markov
model for coding regions and non-coding regions, this step identifies
the most likely reading frame and translates nucleotide sequences into
amino acids sequences. The predicted coding regions, possibly more than
one per fragment, are called features.</p>
<p><strong>coding, Protein</strong> (4465825.3.350.genecalling.coding.faa)</p>
<p>A amino-acid sequence FASTA formatted file containing the translations
of the predicted coding regions.</p>
<p><strong>coding, DNA</strong> (4465825.3.350.genecalling.coding.fna)</p>
<p>A nucleotide sequence FASTA formatted file containing the predicted
coding regions. RNA Clustering</p>
<p>Sequences from step 2 (before dereplication) are pre-screened for at
least 60% identity to ribosomal sequences and then clustered at 97%
identity using UCLUST. These clusters are checked for similarity against
the ribosomal RNA databases (Greengenes(DeSantis et al. 2006), LSU and
SSU from (Pruesse et al. 2007), and RDP(Cole et al. 2003)).</p>
<p><strong>rna97, DNA</strong> (4465825.3.440.cluster.rna97.fna)</p>
<p>A FASTA formatted file containing sequences that have at least 60%
identity to ribosomal sequences and are checked for RNA similarity.</p>
<p><strong>rna97, Cluster</strong> (4465825.3.440.cluster.rna97.mapping)</p>
<p>A tab-delimited file that identifies the sequence clusters and the
sequences that comprise them.</p>
<p>The columns making up each line in this file are:</p>
<p>Cluster ID, e.g. rna97_998</p>
<p>Representative read ID, e.g. 11909294</p>
<p>List of IDs for other reads in the cluster, e.g. 11898451,11944918</p>
<p>List of percentage identities to the representative read sequence, e.g.
97.5%,100.0%</p>
<p><strong>RNA similarities</strong></p>
<p>The two files labelled “expand” are comma- and semicolon- delimited
files that provide the mappings from md5s to function and md5s to
taxonomy:</p>

<p>Packaged results of the blat search against all the DNA databases with
MD5 value of the database sequence hit followed by sequence or cluster
ID, similarity information, annotation, organism, database name.</p>
<p><strong>raw, Sims</strong> (4465825.3.450.rna.sims)</p>
<p>This is the similarity output from BLAT. This includes the identifier
for the query which is either the FASTA id or the cluster ID, and the

<p>score in bits, e.g. 210.0</p>
<p><strong>filtered, Sims</strong> (15:04 4465825.3.450.rna.sims.filter)</p>
<p>This is a filtered version of the raw Sims file above that removes all
but the best hit for each data source. Gene Clustering</p>
<p>Protein coding sequences are clustered at 80% identity with UCLUST. This
process does not remove any sequences but instead makes the similarity
search step easier. Following the search, the original reads are loaded
into MG-RAST for retrieval on-demand.</p>
